### Release 0.1.1

#### What's New:
- **Token Defaults:** Added default settings for Character Actor tokens, including sight, Actor data linking, and disposition.
- **Actor Sheets:** Added the ability to create new Items directly from the Character sheet.

#### Fixes:
- **Multiple Cultures:** Fixed an issue that prevented adding multiple cultures to a Character.
- **Long Rest Dialog:** Corrected the localization string to display properly.
- **Damage Rolls:** Advantage now correctly applies to damage rolls. (Though you can still only apply one count of advantage.)
- **Item Sheets:** Added a max height to Item sheets, so they now scroll instead of growing endlessly, improving readability.
