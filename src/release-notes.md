# Release 0.1.0
This is the first release of the Cosmere Roleplaying Game System. As an early version, itâ€™s expected that some features are incomplete, and bugs may occur. The system has not yet been play-tested, so certain mechanics may not function as intended.  

Key missing or incomplete features include:  
- Support for path-specific skills (e.g., surge skills)
- Multiple damage types on a single item/talent/action
- Character advancement and leveling
- Multiple advantages/disadvantages on damage dice
- Advantage/disadvantage on plot dice
